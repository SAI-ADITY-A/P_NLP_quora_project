# Quora Duplicate Questions Classifier

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model that predicts whether two questions on Quora are duplicates. The application is built using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the model through a web interface.

## Live Demo
You can access the live demo of the application [here](https://quora-nlp.streamlit.app/).

## Features
- Input two questions to check if they are duplicates.
- Displays the probability of the questions being duplicates.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Scikit-learn
- Git LFS for handling large model files
